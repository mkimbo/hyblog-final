Kenya does not have a political problem.. the politics is in order.. what we have is an intellectual problem..
A state is formed by a coalition of several establishments, among these, the military, economic, religious, intellectual and political establishments..
The proper ordering of the state requires a harmonious and constant collaboration among the establishments..
Essentially, the political establishment does not have a life of its own, and derives its energy from the other establishments.. This was most apparent in the previous world order of predominant monarchist states..
In the present world order of democratic-republics though, matters are not as clear-cut.

Rather than deriving its life energy from the other establishments, the political establishment assumes to derive its life from the mandate of the people.. and it is here that the confusion starts.. But before looking at it closely, lets draw the contrasts..

A typical monarch ruled by the mandate of Heaven, God, Divine, etc.. the monarch was, (and still is, for those who still use monarchy) the representative of divinity and that gave him the right to rule.. This way, he borrowed the authority to rule from the religious establishment.. He maintained this authority through military force, hence relying on the military establishment. He was able to mark his rule by advancing territory and commissioning "developmental" projects such as public building.. and to do this he had to tax the population.. i.e., he sustained his rule through the economic establishment. Finally, throughout his reign, he would surround himself with intellectuals as advisers and he would patronize artists, thus employing the intellectual establishment.
This brief sketch justifies the supposition that the political establishment, at least in the monarchist world order, derived its life from other establishments, and for better or worse, this propelled the wheel of history for two millennia..

Now let's come to the democratic-republics.. The political establishment is still the dominant establishment, but it assumes to derive its life directly from the mandate of the people, and by so doing, claims to possess overall authority.. all other establishments are but Subsidiary, as opposed to collaborative. In principle, anyone can join the political establishment, and this is viewed as progressive, but far from this solving the problems of our modern societies, it only accentuates them, blurring the edges so much so it becomes compounded and infinitely difficult to even approach the problems let alone attain tlhe level of providing solutions..Let me illustrate..

Two major problems attend to this system.. Since every citizen with passes the threshold requirements is, in theory, admissible into the political establishment, the nature of the contests ensure that those elected aren't necessarily the most capable nor the most knowledgeable not the most experienced in statecraft, but the most charismatic.. The contests aren't rendered as rational choices but rather as survival choices.. the politicians exploit the divisions existing within the superstructure of the society, and in some instances go a step further and create them.. when these divisions are clashed against each other, then it becomes a matter of survival.. and in a contest of survival, humans will not a rational choice.. they will choose the one the deem the best savior, in the immediate circumstances.. they revert to their base animalistic survival instincts.. they choose the strong, the most vicious, the one who exudes most courage. In a word, the one with the most charisma.. It matters not what skills he has, what qualifications he possess, what knowledge he commands. Its about survival, and so its about the fittest.

And this is how we end up with the politicians we have.. when we analyse politics and the mess thereof, its often easy to lay all the blame on the voters.. and indeed, for a rational thinker, it beats logic how certain politicians get elected.. Its embarrassing to hear them talk, its painful to watch them debate policies, its tortuous to live with the consequences of their decisions.. "How stupid were the voters?"

But voters are not stupid.. they make the right choices under the circumstances.. the contests is constructed as a survival contest and the decision is forced through public opinion.. The decision is obviously a desperate and emotive one..

The second problem is a little more technical.. Politics is the art of distribution. When you distill the essence of politics, it comes down to one thing.. Taking from one and giving to another.. Without going into dense details, let it suffice to mention that under the present system, it becomes difficult, indeed impossible to guarantee justice in this distribution.

Matters were simpler in a monarchy.. since the royal family, through institutionalized propaganda is raised to a station of semi-divinity, there exist mechanism to construct an arrangement that can at least promise justice, if not guarantee it. (This is not to say that this was so, but that at least it could be so, with the right conditions)
Under democratic-republics, however, justice is impossible. The very premise of the mandate (typically a two-third majority) makes it impossible to even envision a possible arrangement that can institute justice in distribution. "Majority have their way and minority have their way" is not justice.. Justice is about ALL, not majority.. Otherwise slavery would be just as well.

The two problems sketchily highlighted combine to produce a very difficult situation, a philosophical maze..
whatever problem there is, it lies outside politics. Which is why i premised this piece by characterizing it as an intellectual problem. The politics has but adhered to its nature. Water takes the shape of the container. To reshape the container, the intellectuals need to step in.. But the biggest tragedy of all is that they lead the chorus in blaming everything on the politicians..

We don't need to fix our politics.. we need to restructure our systems and reorder our world!!
