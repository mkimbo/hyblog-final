A national discourse needs to be anchored on a moment of nationhood for it to have life, vitality and momentum. If we are in agreement that we need to engage in a national discourse then it behooves us to make an attempt in reclaiming the lost moment of nationhood. And having thus far outlined how such a loss occurred, the reclamation is but a conscious exercise to retrace our steps and effect the necessary corrections and adjustments. But to give this discussion validity, I feel obliged to demonstrate the need and indeed urgency for such reclamation.

We are barely eighteen months to another general election and the political situation alone is very disturbing to say the least. As already pointed out, the last attempt at a moment of nationhood achieved little by way of unity. If you will pardon the repetition, peace is not unity. To confuse the two is to set oneself for disaster. A significant portion of the political class felt alienated, and with good reasons. The ruling party is fractured beyond repair and the political marriage between the president and his deputy is undergoing a messy and noisy divorce, one that’s guaranteed to claim considerable casualties. But all these are petty concerns compared to the elephant in the room.

To alienate a tribe is one thing. But to alienate the youths of the country and where these youths make up the largest proportion of the population is a guarantee for a very bloody revolution simmering, awaiting the opportune time to erupt. Here’s where matters get complicated. The BBI debate has now been staged in direct opposition to the Hustler nation narrative. The anatomy of the Hustle nation warrants of series of essays of its own, one I hope to embark on before it’s too late to breathe sense into the political dialectics. To be sure, the Hustler nation exists and it represents a more relevant conversation to the multitudes of youths.

Remember the chorus of unemployment we have been singing for decades? That’s the natural outcome. Our failure at reforms has inadvertently birthed a population determined to make it on their own. Graduates who have lacked meaningful jobs have resolved to hustle their way through the travails of 21st century Kenya. This resolve is motivated and fed by a residual anger at the system and indeed establishment to keep the one promise it repeated throughout the child’s development. “Go to school, get good grades, and get a good job”. The disappointment and despondency resulting from the failure of society at large to keep this promise is the energy that animates the “Hustler Nation”. While the politicians riding with this narrative are mainly doing so for political expediency, it doesn’t negate the actual danger that exists. You are poking a sleeping dragon. If and when it awakens it will know no master. It will spray fire to everything within its sight. It will lay waste to both land and sea.

The danger of staging a contest between the BBI and the Hustler nation is that it’s a strategy without an endgame. If the BBI side wins, that will in effect mean the alienation of the “Hustler nation”, or at least that’s how it will be phrased. Alienating the hustler nation is akin to weaponizing them. And that will very much awaken the dragon. If the “Hustler nation” wins the contest, that will awaken the dragon anyway. Hence in the end, the dragon master and his perceived enemies will both perish at the hands of the dragon. There’s no winner in this context. But in the hope that it’s not too late, we can begin work on the intellectual framing of a constructive discourse. I call the reader’s attention to the events of the French and by extension the Russian revolution. The third estate and the workers, who were still effectively serfs, had been alienated by the establishment; this despite the fact that they constituted the majority. To alienate the majority of our population is to create a siege situation with you as the besieged party.
It is these tremors signifying an imminent volcanic eruption that make the reclamation of the moment of nationhood a matter of national urgency.

The task of reclamation involves three stages the antitheses of which have already been sufficiently covered for present purposes. Step one: _tell a story that actually has meaning_. Without meaning our suffering turn into hopelessness and that hopelessness makes life appear with little value. And when people see no value in life they make a mess on their way out. A real and total mess. Step two: _provide a platform for intellectual fruition_. A nation is built on ideas and ideas need space and freedom to grow and fly. Step three: _adopt the appropriate method_. We are confronted with deep and fundamental issues. To address them we need to choose a rigorous approach that will yield desirable results. A national discourse is not a political contest. It is the one time to put differences aside to weave together a nation that will survive for centuries. Longevity is what signals to the strength and fortitude of the foundations of nations.
Having reclaimed the moment, we can now move to create an actual national discourse.

### TOWARDS THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL DISCOURSE

As this will form the subject matter of subsequent entries in this series within the context of the nine issues highlighted by the two leaders, I need not get into too much detail here. I need only make a solemn proposition, in light of the lengthy discussion we’ve had; that such a national discourse will make sense only when anchored on the nine issues as the subject matter but viewed within the context of a nation, a significant majority of which identify themselves as hustler nation. And it just so happens that this hustler nation is also the inheritor of the nation we are forging together. We must approach the discourse with sincere intentions and create an atmosphere of accommodation.

Before we can develop our nation we must first build it. Before we can build it we must conceive it. To conceive it, we must appreciate the value inherent in a moment of nationhood. Let us thus come together to provide the much needed womb in which to conceive the nation. And let us in the end betroth it to our progeny with the satisfaction that we each did our best.

<p><em>If they ask how I spent my youth,<br> 
Tell them the nation called,<br>
And I heeded the call.<br>
Upon which I found a great truth, <br>
With a mixture of joy and sorrow,<br>
That I was the nation,<br>
And the nation was i.<br>
Joyful that I did my best,<br>
Sorrowful that I wished I had <br>done more.
Long were the years I waited and yearned<br>
For a savior to come and open the gates.<br>
Vast were the lands I traveled and searched<br>
For a guardian to descend and make my path.<br>
I wish I knew before ‘twas too late, <br>
That I was the nation, <br>
And the nation was i. <br>
And now I stand and the edge of time<br>
Staring blindly at the starry sky.<br>
Listen child, for you are next in line<br>
Heed the call and you too will understand why<br>
I am the nation <br>
And the nation is i.</em></p>
