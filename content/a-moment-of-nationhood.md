There comes a time when the right combination of circumstances and people unite to create a moment whose significance balloons beyond expectations, and give rise to a chain of events that end up changing the course of history, inspire the rise of new ideologies, signals the restructuring of society and heralds the birth of a new era. The domineering forces of status quo conspire to make sure such moments are few and rare, but every once in a while, the winds of change blow with such mighty defiance as to guarantee that history is graced with brief instances when the status quo is halted, if only for a moment, and the angelic guardians of reforms get a window to rewrite history. Such moments occupy a special place in the annals of history, command a religious reverence in the hearts of contemporaries and provide a never-ending stream of inspiration to future generations who trace their identity back to them. Such moments codify the story of a people, providing meaning to their pain, trials and travails of the past, and embody the dreams and destiny of a future they strive towards. They provide a fecund womb in which to conceive a nation and a sacred tomb in which to encrust the spirit of nationhood. Such a moment is a moment of nationhood.

Before delving into the subject matter of this essay and anchor our vessel on our very own shores so that we can disembark and traverse our motherland, perhaps we should, by way of illustrating just how momentous a moment of nationhood can be, we take a tour into the depths of time and the vastness of the seas and lands to marvel at examples of such moments of nationhood.

Such was the moment when on the 4th of July 1776, the thirteen colonies ratified the Declaration of Independence to conceive the nation that would become the United States of America, holding such truths to be self-evident, as that all men are born equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Such was the moment when on the 20th of June 1789 the Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath voting "not to separate and to reassemble wherever necessary, until the Constitution of the kingdom is established”, signaling the birth of a new France which proclaimed to uphold Liberty, Equality and Fraternity as the founding ideals. Such was the moment when in Aril 1917 Vladmir Ilych Ulyanov (Lenin) disembarked from the train in Petrograd, alongside 29 of his compatriots, breathing life and vitality into the revolution and promising the masses the three essentials, “peace, bread, land”.

Such was the moment when on the 29th October 1923 Mustafa Kamal proclaimed the birth of modern turkey. Such was the moment in many other nations, and such, I dare say, was the moment, on the 9th of March 2018, on the steps of Harambee House, when the President and the former Prime Minister embraced each other in the iconic “handshake” and announced they were ready and willing to rethink the foundations of our nation, redesign the pillars of our society and re-tailor the fabric of our identity. Yes, it was a moment of nationhood. Or was it?

I have cited the above examples for the purpose of conjuring up an image of the mood that permeates a moment of nationhood, the emotions that prevail, the aspirations sour and the course the succeeding events follow. We will thus, in the subsequent lines of this essay, call into aid illustrations from the four historical settings, as we try to contextualize our own setting. To be sure, 9th of March isn’t the only moment of nationhood to have occasioned our country, quite the contrary. There have been numerous such moments. But as we will endeavor to reveal, the significance of the moment lies not in the instance of culmination itself, but in the preparation that leads to this moment and more importantly in the events immediately following such moments.

Be that as it may, 9th of March is the most recent example, the memory of which is still fresh in our imagination, the impact of which is still felt to date, the implications of which have shaped the politics of the country hence. But before we get into the details, let’s first define, for our present context, what a moment of nationhood really is.
As will be easily inferred from the examples cited above, there are three key ingredients which combine in a complex recipe involving long histories, foundational ideologies and ebb and flow of prevailing events, that give birth to what we will call a moment of nationhood.

A moment of nationhood is a climactic event that combines in one pot, both the past and future of a nation; an event that captures both the pain and potentialities of a people; an event that embodies both the soul and spirit of the people and yet still reflects the raging realities of a country. It is during such an event that the story of a nation is written, its identity forged, its journey commissioned and its position on the global geopolitical food chain established. So what exactly constitutes a moment of nationhood?

The first ingredient is a story of struggle shared by the members of the given society. It is this story which does give meaning to existence and lend the nation its legitimacy. The second ingredient is the availability of statesmen of towering vision. Their guidance provides a map with which to navigate the endless maze of nation-building. The third ingredient is a stake to be won. This provides the motivation that makes the journey a worthy endeavor. Story, statesman and stake. We will examine these in turn to see the role each play in the creation of a moment of nationhood. More importantly, we will look at each in relation to the events of 9th March, in a bid to render the “handshake” and the events that followed it, in their proper context.
